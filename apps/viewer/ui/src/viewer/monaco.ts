 * functions a component needs — so `TextViewer.tsx` reads as a React component
 * and nothing else in `apps/files/` imports Monaco at all. The one exception is
 * a *type-only* import in `tabs/useOpenFiles.ts`, which `import type` erases
 * before Rollup ever sees it; see the note there.
 *
 * That matters beyond tidiness. `apps/` is not a pnpm workspace member, so
 * Monaco sits in the repository root's dependencies with nothing scoping it to
 * this app; the only thing keeping it out of the Files entry chunk, and out of
 * the shell's, is that the sole runtime path here is the dynamic `import()`
 * behind the `text` viewer in `registry.ts`. **Nothing may import this module
 * statically from anything reachable at load.** What it deliberately does not
 * do — no `editor.main`, no `languages/features/typescript`, no diff editor
 * wiring — and why, is in `docs/design-notes/viewer-renderers.md`.
