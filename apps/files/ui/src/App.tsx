/**
 * File Explorer — the tree, and the questions it has to ask before it changes
 * anything on disk. This file is the join: it owns where the tree is rooted and
 * the one confirmation bar the app may show, and nothing else. The tree itself
 * is `explorer/`; what a row looks like is `explorer/TreeRow.tsx`.
 *
 * This app no longer shows a file. Clicking a row asks the shell for a File
 * Viewer *in this cluster* and hands it a path (`openIn`,
 * `docs/tool-protocol.md` §3). The Explorer does not know whether a Viewer
 * exists, does not know its instance id, and cannot address one; the shell
 * finds or opens it — which is what makes the tree and the editor two surfaces
 * you can put in two panes, or on two monitors. Three things that used to be
 * answerable by reading another region's state are now facts the Viewer
 * volunteers, each documented at its subscription below.
 *
 * The splitter is gone with the editor: a pane is the shell's to divide now,
 * and it already did that better than the old one, which could only ever put
 * the tree left of the file, in one window.
