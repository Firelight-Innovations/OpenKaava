 * The app's right-click menu. One implementation, three places it opens from:

 *
 * It used to live in `explorer/` and be the explorer's. It moved up here when
 * the tab strip needed one too — not for tidiness, but because the alternative
 * was `tabs/` importing a component out of `explorer/`, which would have said
 * the tab strip is built on the tree. It is not. Both are regions of this app,
 * and this is the app's menu.
 *
 * It offers: create a file, create a folder, rename, **delete**, copy the path,
 * copy it relative to the project, reveal in the OS file manager, open with the
 * default app. Which of those appear is decided field by field on `MenuTarget`
 * below.
 *
 * Why Delete is here now, when this file used to argue it should not be:
 * `docs/design-notes/files-app.md`.
