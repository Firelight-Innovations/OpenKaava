/**
 * Comment-density checks for Rust and TypeScript, with a ratchet.
 *
 * STANDARDS.md §4 asks this codebase to explain itself in prose, and it does —
 * but prose has a runaway mode, and two shapes of it are worth catching: RATIO
 * and RUN, each documented on the `MAX_RATIO` and `MAX_RUN` constants below.
 * The two catch genuinely different files, which is why both are on. Neither
 * is a statement that the prose is wrong — §4 is still the standard, and a
 * long comment that records a rejected alternative is the most valuable thing
 * in the repo. These are limits on *concentration*, not on total.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-comments.mjs            check against the baseline
 *   node scripts/check-comments.mjs --update    rewrite the baseline
 *   node scripts/check-comments.mjs --report    print every file, worst first
