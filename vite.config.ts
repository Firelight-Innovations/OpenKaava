 * points the webview at a *fixed* URL, so that port cannot move and cannot be
 * shared. Anything else holding it doesn't degrade, it fails the whole run.
 *
 * Agents verifying work in a plain browser therefore get their own range via
 * `pnpm dev:agent`, and `strictPort` is off for them so a second and third
 * agent step up to 1431, 1432 rather than colliding. `--mode agent` is what
 * selects it: a CLI flag Vite already understands, so this needs no env var
 * and no `cross-env` shim to work the same in PowerShell and bash.
 *
 * 1430 rather than 1421 because 1421 is taken below by HMR when
 * `TAURI_DEV_HOST` is set for mobile.

      //
      // It produces no chunks of its own. `splash.html` imports nothing: its
      // styles, SVGs, wordmark font and boot logic are all inlined into the
      // file itself, so Vite finds no module graph to bundle and copies it
      // through verbatim. That is deliberate — see the comment at the top of
      // `splash.html` for why the splash window is kept free of any
      // dependency on this application's code.
      //
      // The first-party apps are entries for a different reason. Each is a
      // separate document mounted in an iframe (`src-tauri/src/apps/`), so each
      // needs its own HTML and its own module graph — but they are built *here*,
      // by the shell's own config, rather than by a Vite project of their own.
      //
      // There is one entry per row in `apps::REGISTRY`, and this is the piece
      // that cannot be inferred from that list: Vite has to be told about every
      // HTML entry point or it silently builds none of it. An app added to the
      // registry without a line here mounts a 404.
      //
      // That is what makes `apps::entry_url` able to hand back a root-relative
      // path and be right under both hosts. An entry's HTML lands in `dist/` at
      // the path it occupies in the source tree, so `apps/home/ui/index.html`
      // is reachable at `/apps/home/ui/index.html` from Vite in development and
      // from Tauri's asset host in a release build — one URL, no per-app dev
      // server to remember to start, and nothing to add to `bundle.resources`.
