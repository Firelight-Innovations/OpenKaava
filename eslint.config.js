 *
 * What is deliberately absent: typescript-eslint's `recommended` and
 * `*-type-checked` tiers. They catch real defects `tsc --strict` misses
 * (`no-floating-promises` above all) and are the obvious next step, but they
 * are a much larger baseline than the documented rules, and mixing "things we
 * agreed to in writing" with "things the ecosystem suggests" in one pass makes
 * neither reviewable. Escalate by adding `tseslint.configs.recommended` below
 * once the current baseline is worked down.
 *
 * Existing violations are grandfathered in `eslint-suppressions.json`, not by
 * relaxing rules. A new violation in an old file still fails.

 *
 * `state` is not a region. It draws nothing. It is the shell's verb layer —

 * in violation, and the only conforming alternative was to thread nine more

 * the tree. The isolation that mattered is kept, and enforced below: `state`
 * may not import a region, so the arrow still points one way.
 *
 * `scrollbar` is gone entirely. It held one component that four regions
 * wanted, which is the definition of a shared widget rather than a region;
