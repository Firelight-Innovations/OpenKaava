//! Design Mode's Rust half: which page may be embedded, what may be put inside
//! it, how a picture of part of it is taken, and the comments left on what was
//! picked.
//!
//! The first three methods are each here because they could not be a component.
//! `design/target` decides what may be loaded at all — a security boundary
//! rather than a convenience, and the one part of this feature that most needs
//! a careful read. `design/arm` installs the probe through
//! `devtools::install_script`, because same-origin policy means nothing in the
//! shell can reach into a frame showing somebody else's origin.
//! `design/capture` crops a screenshot out of the window.
//!
//! **Nothing about a *frame* is remembered here**, like `files::call`: a second
//! Design Mode in a second cluster is a second frame with its own probe. The
//! `design/comment/*` methods are the other side of that rule rather than an
//! exception to it — see `docs/design-notes/design-comments.md`.
//!
//! `docs/design-notes/design-mode.md` is the long form — what each rule in
//! [`normalize`] is defending against, and exactly what a hostile page in that
//! frame can and cannot reach.
