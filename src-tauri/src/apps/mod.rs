//! First-party apps — the surfaces this repo ships itself.
//!
//! To the shell an app and a tool are the same thing: a tab in the switcher bar
//! and an iframe in the tool window, speaking transport B of
//! `docs/tool-protocol.md`. What differs is where the two halves come from, and
//! that difference is the whole reason apps are their own concept.
//!
//! A **tool** is another repository: its frontend is served out of its own
//! checkout, its Rust core is a child process the shell spawns and talks to over
//! the standard streams — two processes, two transports, joined by a broker that
//! is not built yet. An **app** ships inside the orchestrator: its frontend is an
//! extra entry point in this repo's own Vite config, its Rust half a module right
//! here, reached over transport B and dispatched by [`call`] below — no child
//! process, no broker in between.
