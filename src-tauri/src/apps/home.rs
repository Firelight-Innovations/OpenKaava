//! The Home app's Rust half — projects.
//!
//! Home is where a session starts, and what a session starts *on* is a project.
//! So this is a thin layer over `crate::project`: it picks folders, and it turns
//! that module's `Result<ProjectSnapshot>` into the JSON-RPC shape an app's
//! frontend receives. The rules about what a project is live there, not here.
//!
//! The dialogs live here, and `crate::project` never opens one. That module
//! takes paths and touches the filesystem, which makes it testable and makes
//! "open this project" a thing the rest of the orchestrator can do without a
//! human at the keyboard — a command line flag, a recent-projects jump list, a
//! `.kaava` file double-clicked in Explorer. Choosing a folder by pointing at it
//! is a *user interface* act, and this module is Home's user interface half.
