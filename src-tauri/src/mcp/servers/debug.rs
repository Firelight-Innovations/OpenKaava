//! What OpenKaava looks like from the inside, for the agent working on it.
//!
//! [`servers`](super)'s rule is that a server answers what no harness could
//! answer for itself. An agent can read every file in this repo and still not
//! know whether the window it just changed drew two panes or four, or that a
//! store failed to write forty seconds ago. `layout.json` is the closest thing
//! on disk and it lags the screen and is silent about every failure.
//!
//! **Every tool here is a read**, and that boundary is deliberate rather than a
//! matter of what got built first: the endpoint is reachable by anything on the
//! machine holding the token, so a leaked token should cost knowledge of a
//! window layout and not control of it.
//!
//! Full argument, including why this ships in release builds:
//! `docs/design-notes/agent-debugging.md`.
//!
//! [`super::agent`] hosts these three by delegation, next to the tools that
//! drive the window; prefer it while *working on* OpenKaava. This module is what
//! diagnoses a build with only the reads. Both need developer mode, and both
//! are registered rather than one replacing the other.
