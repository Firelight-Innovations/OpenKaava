//! The MCP servers this build hosts.
//!
//! One module each, owning its tool descriptors, schemas and handler, and
//! declaring a single `pub static SERVER` for [`seed`] to register.
//!
//! **If the harness can already do it, it does not get a server.** No file
//! reading, writing or listing, no search, no git. Every agent worth pointing at
//! OpenKaava arrives with those, and a second worse copy costs a permission surface
//! and a pile of tool descriptions competing for the model's attention.
//!
//! What earns a server is something that exists only inside OpenKaava and has no
//! filesystem equivalent — Schematify's design model is the first real case, because
//! an agent cannot read a spec's *boundaries* by opening a file. [`debug`] is
//! the second, [`design`] the third and [`ui`] the fourth; each module's doc says
//! what earns its place, and what decides its gate where it writes.
//!
//! [`agent`] is the fifth and the exception, earning its place on the client's
//! axis rather than a capability's: eleven of its fourteen tools are [`ui`]'s
//! and [`debug`]'s, composed so one job needs one connection instead of four.
//! It indexes their arrays and delegates, so nothing here is a second copy.
