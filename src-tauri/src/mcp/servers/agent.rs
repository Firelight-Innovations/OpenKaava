//! The one server an agent working on OpenKaava connects to.
//!
//! Everything needed to drive this window behind a single endpoint: the ten
//! interaction tools [`super::ui`] owns, the three reads [`super::debug`] owns,
//! and three that had no home before — [`app_call`] reaches any app's Rust
//! half, [`open_app`] mounts one, [`set_project`] points a cluster at a folder
//! without raising a picker.
//!
//! One server rather than four because the tools are separable and the *task*
//! is not: testing an app means screenshotting it, reading the shell layout,
//! calling a method, then checking `recent_errors` — one loop, and otherwise
//! four switches to leave off. [`super::ui`] and [`super::debug`] stay
//! registered for the cases that want them alone, and [`TOOL_LIST`] composes
//! their tools rather than restating them.
//!
//! `dev_only`, for [`super::ui`]'s reason rather than a new one: this can
//! click, and `eval` reaches every `#[tauri::command]`. Gating `debug`'s reads
//! *here* is what `debug` staying registered is for — a release build that
//! misbehaves is still diagnosed through `kaava-debug`, ungated, as before.
