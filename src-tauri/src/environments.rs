//! What a cluster's work runs against: a local worktree, a cloud session, the
//! read-only main checkout, or the one standing Design worktree.
//!
//! Before this module, a cluster's only notion of "where" was
//! [`crate::shell_state::WorktreeRef`] — a worktree, or nothing, with
//! "nothing" silently meaning "the project folder itself". That collapsed two
//! different cases (a cluster with no checkout concept at all, and a cluster
//! deliberately browsing the main checkout) into one, and had no way to name
//! a cloud session at all. [`Environment`] replaces the collapse with four
//! named cases — see the variant docs — while [`crate::shell_state::Cluster`]
//! keeps `worktree` for backward compatibility; [`migrate_environment`] is
//! the bridge between the two.
