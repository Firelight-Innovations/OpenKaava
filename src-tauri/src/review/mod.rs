//! Review comments — what a person wrote on a line of a diff, so an agent can read it back.
//!
//! A comment is a note anchored to a line range of one file, in one of the three diffs the
//! source-control surfaces draw: the unstaged view, the staged view, or a worktree's divergence
//! from where it forked. `.kaava/` inside the checkout is where they live, and [`store`] is the
//! whole of that.
//!
//! It carries **no author and no thread**. There are exactly two parties — the person at the
//! keyboard and whatever agent they hand the note to — so a name on every note would say the same
//! thing every time, and a reply from the agent arrives as a new diff rather than as a message.
//! That is the one place this departs from the review-host shape it is modelled on, and it is
//! deliberate rather than unfinished.
//!
//! [`ReviewComment`] is modelled on `src/shared/diff-comment-types.ts` in `stablyai/orca`, which is
//! MIT-licensed, © Stably AI — the line anchoring and what each timestamp means are that file's.
//! `NOTICE` carries the attribution in full.
//!
//! The argument for anchoring to line numbers, and for what happens when the file moves underneath
//! one, is in `docs/design-notes/backend-core.md`.
