//! Built-in skills: skills Veistra ships and gives to the agents it runs.
//!
//! A skill is a folder holding `SKILL.md` and whatever it points at. The
//! sources live in the repository's `skills/` and are compiled into the binary
//! with `include_bytes!`, so the copy an agent reads is always this build's.
//! Rejected: `bundle.resources` in `tauri.conf.json`. A resource has to be
//! found through `resource_dir()` with a separate dev fallback (see
//! `manifest.rs`), and the files have to be copied into each harness's layout
//! anyway, so embedding them removes a lookup without adding a copy.
//!
//! How each harness gets them is its descriptor's `SkillDelivery`:
//!
//! - **Claude**: a plugin folder under Veistra's app data, passed per session
//!   in `_meta.claudeCode.options.plugins`. Nothing touches `~/.claude` or the
//!   project.
//! - **Codex**: no per-session route exists, and `CODEX_HOME` would move the
//!   user's sign-in. So the skill is copied into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (or
//!   `~/.codex/skills`) with a [`MARKER`] file. Veistra replaces or removes
//!   only a folder holding that marker, never a user's own skill.
//! - **Any other**: a hint in the first prompt naming the `SKILL.md` path.
