//! The bridge between Rust and the web frontend.

//! Every `#[tauri::command]` here becomes callable from TypeScript via

//! JSON, which is why the types involved derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize`.
//!
//! Note the naming convention: Rust `snake_case` command names are invoked from
//! JS by that same snake_case string, but their *arguments* are converted to
//! camelCase. The typed wrappers in `src/bindings.ts` hide that asymmetry.
