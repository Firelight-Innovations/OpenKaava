//! Source control: what `git` says about a cluster's checkout.
//!
//! This shells out to the system `git` binary rather than linking a library (`git2`). A deliberate
//! trade: the user's credential helper, SSH agent, `.gitconfig`, hooks and aliases are all things
//! `git` already knows about and a linked library would have to be taught. The cost is that every
//! answer arrives as text that has to be parsed.
//!
//! Everything here is one-shot request→reply. There is no watcher and no subscription — the panel
//! re-asks after every mutation and when the shown cluster changes. Long-running,
//! progress-reporting operations (push, pull, clone) would want the pty machinery instead; none of
//! them live here.
//!
//! Commands take a cluster *id*, never a path. Resolving the id to a checkout happens on this side,
//! through `project::cluster_path`, so the frontend never gets to name a directory for the backend
//! to run `git` in. They used to take a *tool* id, resolved against the `[[tool]]` pins in
//! `kaava.toml`. That was not merely the wrong scope: `discovery.rs` filters those pins through
//! `ENABLED_TOOLS`, which is `&[]`, so the list is empty for every project and the lookup could
//! only ever fail. See the note on `git_cluster_status` for what that cost.
