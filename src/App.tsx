/**
 * Owns the stack snapshot and hands it to the shell.
 *
 * All this does is data: fetch, refresh, and error state. Everything about how
 * the app looks and what it shows lives under `shell/`. Keeping the fetch here
 * rather than inside the shell means the shell can be restyled or rearranged
 * without anything having to know how the snapshot is obtained.
 *
 * Settings is mounted here rather than in `WindowRoot` because it is the one
 * surface that is not about a window — see `docs/settings.md` §9, which also
 * says why the title bar and the status bar stay uncovered. The session is read
 * once, above the window, so the appearance settings apply whether or not the
 * screen has ever been opened.
