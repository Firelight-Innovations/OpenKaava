 * unstages it, a click that shows that file's diff, and a commit box.
 *
 * The status itself is *not* owned here — see `useGitStatus.ts` for why it
 * lives in `WindowRoot` and arrives as a prop. Everything else (which file is
 * selected, its diff, the commit message) is view-local and deliberately reset
 * when the shown cluster changes: none of it means anything in another repo.
 *
 * Scoped to a cluster, not a tool — see the `clusterId` prop below.
 *
 * No motion, for the same reason `WorktreeView` had none — the handoff's
 * motion section is explicit that this list stays at native scroll speed.
