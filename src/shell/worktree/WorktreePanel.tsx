/**
 * The worktree tab's whole body: a vertically split panel with the
 * repository's history on top and this cluster's own changes on the bottom,
 * a draggable divider between them.
 *
 * Meant to become what `WindowRoot` hands `SecondaryPanel`'s `worktreeView`
 * slot in place of `SourceControlView` alone — not wired up by this file (see
 * the props note below).
 *
 * ## Why two sections instead of one
 *
 * The top is about the *repository* — `CommitGraph` over every branch,
 * whichever cluster happens to be active — and the bottom is about *this
 * cluster's own work*: what its worktree has changed since it forked, or, for
 * a cluster with no worktree, the ordinary staged/unstaged view. Switching
 * clusters on the same repository leaves the top alone and replaces the
 * bottom, which is the whole reason they are drawn as two independent
 * sections rather than one scrolling list.
