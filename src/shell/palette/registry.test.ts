/**
 * The palette's rows are the menu bar's rows, and this is what holds them to it.
 *
 * The failure worth guarding is the one a second hand-written command table
 * would have caused and this design avoids: a palette that offers something the
 * menu no longer does, or runs a row the menu has greyed out. So the assertions
 * below are all about *derivation* — what a menu tree turns into, and what it
 * refuses to turn into.
 *
 * Menus are built by hand here rather than by calling `defaultMenus`, which
 * lives in the `titlebar` region and STANDARDS.md §1.2 puts out of reach. That
 * is the better test anyway: it covers the flattening, not the current contents
 * of the File menu.
