 * written, and then a row renamed in the menu keeps its old name in the palette
 * and nothing fails. The menu model is already rebuilt from live state every
 * render and already carries every field a palette row needs, so this flattens
 * it. One source of truth by construction rather than by discipline.
 *
 * What that costs: a command has to be *in a menu* to be in the palette — and
 * that is the right constraint, since a palette-only command would be an action
 * with no discoverable home, which is the problem a palette exists to solve.
