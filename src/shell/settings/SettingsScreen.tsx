/**
 * The settings screen: a header, a list of sections, and the selected one.
 *
 * ## Why it covers the band between the two bars, and not the window
 *
 * The title bar stays because it *is* the window controls: this is a frameless
 * Tauri window, so minimise, maximise and close are drawn by the shell in
 * `.frame__titlebar` rather than by the OS, and covering them would leave the
 * window unclosable for as long as settings was open.
 *
 * The status bar stays for an unrelated reason — it keeps reporting while any
 * transient surface is up, as every one of them in this shell does, and it holds
 * the glyph that opened this screen. `settings.css` spells out both.
 *
 * Nothing below is per-setting: every row comes from the schema Rust publishes,
 * so adding a setting is a Rust-only edit. The MCP panel and the Google account
 * panel are the two exceptions; `McpPanel.tsx` and `CloudAccountPanel.tsx` say
 * why.
