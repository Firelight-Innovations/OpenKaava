/**
 * One setting: what it is on the left, what it is set to on the right.
 *
 * The row is the same in a section and in a filtered flat list, which is why it
 * knows nothing about either — it takes a `Setting` and the session, and the two
 * callers arrange them.
 *
 * Anatomy: label (title, description, when it applies), the control in a
 * column of its own, and a reset slot at the right edge that is reserved even
 * when empty. A modified row gets a 6px accent dot after its title; the design
 * system forbids coloured side bars on rows.
 *
 * "When it applies" is drawn because most settings are read when something is
 * *made* (a pty spawned, an editor mounted), so a control that moves and changes
 * nothing on screen looks broken. Nothing is drawn for `now`: a note under every
 * control trains people to stop reading it.
