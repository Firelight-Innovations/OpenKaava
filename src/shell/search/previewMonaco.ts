 * The only module in this directory that touches `monaco-editor`.

 * `PreviewPane.tsx` reads as a React component and a state machine; everything
 * Monaco-shaped — the worker environment, the language registrations, the
 * theme, and the handful of factory functions the pane needs — lives here,
 * mirroring the split `apps/files/ui/src/viewer/monaco.ts` draws for the same
 * reason (see that file's header).
 *
 * `docs/design-notes/shell-search.md` records what was taken from `DiffView.tsx`
 * and from Files' `monaco.ts`.
 *
 * Imported from `monaco-editor/editor/editor.api`, not `.../editor.main`, for
 * the reason DiffView's header gives: `editor.main` registers every bundled
 * language and the full IntelliSense infrastructure as an import side effect,
 * none of which a read-only preview needs.

 * A curated set of languages, one `register.js` each — ported from the list in
 * `apps/files/ui/src/viewer/monaco.ts`, minus two of its entries.
 *
 * Each registers an id and a *lazy* loader, so a grammar is only fetched the
 * first time a file of that language is previewed.
 *
 * Unlike Files' list there is no `features/register.all`: a read-only glance
 * pane needs no find widget, context menu, folding or multi-cursor.
 *
 * TOML is absent because it is not one of Monaco's — see `registerToml` below.
