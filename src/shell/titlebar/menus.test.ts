/**
 * The View and Run menus: every row acts, and the toggles say which state the
 * window is actually in.
 *
 * Two menus in one file because they are one claim — a row that renders live
 * does something — asserted over the two that have been reported for breaking
 * it (#41 for View, #40 for Run). Splitting them would mean two copies of the
 * `MenuHandlers` scaffolding `defaultMenus` requires.
 *
 * `defaultMenus` is a pure function of the handlers it is given, which is what
 * makes the menu testable with no DOM under it (STANDARDS.md §8.3). The bar
 * rebuilds it from live state on every render, so a `Menu[]` built here is the
 * same tree the dropdown would draw.
 *
 * The regression guarded is a row that renders live and silently does nothing —
 * a menu that lies, which `MenuItem.disabled` exists to prevent. It is asserted
 * over the whole menu rather than row by row, because it is stated once in
 * `defaultMenus`' header as a rule, and a rule nothing checks decays.
