 * A read-only diff, rendered with Monaco's `DiffEditor` — two columns by

 * Mounted by the source-control panel (`worktree/SourceControlView.tsx`),
 * which imports it lazily: this module pulls in Monaco and its worker chunk on
 * evaluation, and the panel is mounted for the life of the window whether or
 * not anyone opens a diff. The `lazy` boundary there keeps that cost on the
 * first click rather than on startup.
 *
 * Why the import below is `editor.api` and not `.../editor.main`, why `"toml"`
 * is consequently the only language this editor tokenizes and why that is the
 * shape of the fix rather than an oversight, and how chunks are shared with the
 * Files app's Monaco: docs/design-notes/shell-worktree.md, under this path.
