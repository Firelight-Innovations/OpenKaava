/**
 * Where a file opened from anywhere goes: which File Viewer, and if a new one
 * is needed, which pane it joins.
 *
 * Pure, so the layouts that matter are testable: the shell hands over what it
 * can see (panes, their tabs, sizes, what each viewer reports, what was focused)
 * and gets back a decision. `ToolWindow` carries the decision out.
 *
 * Order, first that applies:
 *  1. A viewer already showing the file is focused.
 *  2. A viewer with no file yet takes it, so an empty viewer is filled rather
 *     than left beside a new tab.
 *  3. A single click (`preview`) takes over the cluster's clean peek viewer.
 *  4. A new viewer opens in the pane that most recently had a viewer focused, or
 *     failing that the pane of the first viewer there is.
 *  5. With no viewer at all, in the largest pane that is not the one asking,
 *     because the asker (the Explorer, search, Canvas) is what the file is
 *     being opened *beside*.
 *  6. The asking pane, only when it is the only pane.
