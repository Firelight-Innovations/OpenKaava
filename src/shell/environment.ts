 * The environment model — display side only. Every cluster is exactly one of

 * main itself, read-only (`docs/KAAVA-UX-REWORK.md` §1-2). [`environmentOf`]
 * reads `Cluster.environment` when the backend has set it, falling back to
 * the older `worktree`/`project` fields for a cluster that predates it.
 * Every caller goes through it rather than either field directly.
 *
 * This file's `Environment` is a display type, not `bindings.Environment`
 * re-exported — it adds `ahead`/`behind` divergence nothing on the wire fills
 * in yet, and a cloud session's `sessionId`/`vm` for the environment bar.
 *
 * `sameEnvironment` below is the **panes** workstream's own, narrower
 * question, kept on `clusterRoot` rather than on `Environment` — see its own
 * doc comment for why.
