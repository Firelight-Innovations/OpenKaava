# Godot: Play, the Godot Viewer, and Open in Godot

Code: `src-tauri/src/godot/` (`detect`, `runner`, `addon`, `scene`, `rpc`), routed from
`apps/play.rs` and `apps/godot_viewer.rs`. Frontends: `apps/play/ui`, `apps/godot-viewer/ui`,
shared types in `apps/shared/godot.ts`.

The rule everything obeys is `KAAVA-UX-REWORK.md` section 3.1: Godot is never embedded in the
webview. It is a native process Kaava starts, watches and stops.

## Section 9.2, decided: a native run

Play runs `godot --path <project>` as a child process of the environment. The game opens in its
own window and the pane shows what Kaava can honestly know about it: state, an stdout/stderr
log with errors and warnings highlighted, and pause, restart and stop.

The alternative was a web export shown in the pane. It was rejected because it needs an export
template and a build step before the first frame, changes what the game is (WebGL, no threads,
no native extensions), and would make "Play" mean a different program from the one that ships.
A native run needs nothing but the engine, and what it shows is what the player gets.

Cost: the frame is not in the pane. That is what Capture is for.

## Finding the engine

`detect.rs`. An explicit `godot.executablePath` setting is authoritative: a bad value is
reported, never silently replaced by another install. With no setting, the order is the
`GODOT4`/`GODOT` variables, `PATH`, common install folders, then Steam libraries. The first
that answers `--version` with a 4.x wins. On Windows the `_console.exe` sibling is preferred
for runs, because the GUI-subsystem exe writes nothing to a pipe. A found engine is remembered
until the setting changes or the pane asks to check again; a failed search is never cached.

Projects are `project.godot` files at or below the environment root (four folders deep,
skipping `.git`, `.godot`, `node_modules`, `.kaava`, `addons`). With several, the pane offers a
picker. A `config_version` of 4 or less is Godot 3 and is refused with a message.

## The run

`runner.rs`. One run per cluster. stdout and stderr are read on their own threads into a
bounded log (4000 lines, oldest dropped, drops counted). Lines are classified from the prefixes
Godot prints (`ERROR:`, `SCRIPT ERROR:`, `WARNING:`), and indented `at:` lines inherit the level
of the line they follow. The pane polls `play/state` with a cursor every 500 ms.

Stop kills the whole tree: `taskkill /T /F` on Windows, the process group on Unix, so the game
window and anything it spawned go with it. `RunEvent::Exit` calls `Godot::shutdown`, so no game
outlives Kaava. `Stopped` (asked for) and `Exited { code }` (the game ended) are different
states.

## Capture & comment, and pause

Godot has no external "give me a frame" interface, so a real screenshot needs code inside the
game. That is the capture addon: one GDScript autoload, opt in per project, consent-gated,
removable.

- Enable adds `addons/kaava/kaava_capture.gd` and one `[autoload]` line to `project.godot`.
  Disable removes exactly those, leaving anything else in `addons/kaava/` alone.
- The channel is a folder in the OS temp directory, passed as `-- --kaava-dir=<dir>`. Kaava
  writes `cmd.json` (atomically), the script answers `res-<id>.json`. No socket, no listener,
  no network. A reply may not name a file outside its own folder.
- Without the addon, Capture and Pause are disabled and say why. Nothing is faked.

## The Godot Viewer

`scene.rs`. Refresh runs `godot --headless --path P -s dump_scene.gd -- --out F --scene S`,
which instantiates the scene without adding it to the tree and writes its nodes as JSON.
`--import` runs first when the project has no `.godot/` cache. The result is cached, stamped,
and shown with its age; nothing runs until someone presses Refresh.

If Godot is missing or the run fails, the tree is parsed from the `.tscn` text instead and the
pane says so ("Read from the scene file - Godot did not run", with the reason). Instanced
scenes take their type from the scene they instance, to a depth of four.

Render view is a separate, explicit action: Godot's Movie Maker mode for one frame, keeping the
last frame written. It is not headless, since a headless run has no renderer, so a Godot window
appears briefly. The frame is cached beside the tree and stamped separately.

## Read-only main (#163)

Running and viewing read the project, so they work on main. Writing does not:
`godot/open-editor`, `play/addon-install` and `play/addon-remove` are in `WRITE_METHODS` and are
refused on main before a handler runs. The viewer's cache goes under the app-local data folder
for main and under `<env>/.kaava/godot-viewer/` for a worktree; run channels are always in temp.

What Kaava cannot prevent: Godot writes `<project>/.godot/` (import cache) whenever it loads a
project. It is engine-generated and gitignored by every Godot template.

## The 3D preview and markup

The Godot Viewer's "3D" tab shows the scene as an orbitable glTF instead of one still frame. It
needs Godot, like the tree does; "Render" is the still frame, and it is what the viewer falls back
to, with the reason, when the export fails.

**Export.** `godot/preview-glb` (params: `scene`, `actor`, optional `force`) runs
`export_glb.gd` headless (`GLTFDocument.append_from_scene`) and answers `ready`, `running` or
`failed`. The file is `<project>/.kaava/preview/godot/<scene-slug>.glb`, one per scene, replaced in
place through a temp file and rename. A `.json` beside it holds the cache key and the node map. The
key hashes the Godot version, the scene, every text scene or resource it references (by content)
and binary assets (by size and modified time), so an unchanged scene answers `ready` without
running Godot. Failures are remembered until `force`. On read-only main the file goes under the
app cache instead of `.kaava`. `actor` must be `human` or `agent`; `system` is refused.
`godot/preview-glb-bytes` hands the file to the viewer (48 MB cap).

**Node paths.** three.js renames nodes it loads (spaces become `_`, and `[ ] . : /` are dropped)
and Godot renames duplicates on export (`Crate2`). The reply's `nodeMap` maps each three.js-side
path to the Godot scene path (`Main/Crate/Crate`), so a pin's `nodePath` in the JSON below is a
Godot path.

**Mark up.** "Mark up" opens the markup layer over the 3D view (Excalidraw loads on first use, so
neither it nor three.js is in the viewer's first chunk). Arrows and boxes snap to nodes, and pins
carry the picked node. Done shows the result with "Send to agent". Sending stores two items, both
overwritten on the next send for that scene: the PNG under `godot/<scene>/markup` and the JSON
under `godot/<scene>/markup-json` (kind text, because the store caps images at 8 MB and text at
256 KB). If the JSON would exceed the cap the raw `excalidraw.elements` are dropped and
`excalidrawOmitted: true` is set; pins and annotations are always kept. Moving the camera during
markup discards it, since the drawing belongs to one view.

The JSON an agent receives is the format in `docs/markup-format.md`, with the source recorded as:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": { "kind": "scene", "glb": ".kaava/preview/godot/main_tscn.glb",
              "engine": "godot", "scene": "res://main.tscn", "godot": "4.7.2" },
  "camera": { "position": [4, 3, 5], "target": [0, 1, 0], "up": [0, 1, 0], "fov": 50 },
  "size": { "width": 640, "height": 360 },
  "pins": [{ "n": 1, "note": "too tall", "nodePath": "Main/Crate", "worldPoint": [1, 0.5, 0] }],
  "annotations": []
}
```
