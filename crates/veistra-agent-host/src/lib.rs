//! The Veistra agent host: runs a coding agent (Claude today; Codex and Pi next)
//! as a child process that speaks the Agent Client Protocol on its standard
//! streams, and turns everything it says into one event model the agent tab
//! draws.
//!
//! No Tauri here. The orchestrator owns where an agent may run (a cluster's
//! local worktree, never main) and how events reach a window; this crate owns
//! the process, the protocol and the normalizing, so `cargo test` can drive a
//! real child — `src/bin/mock-agent.rs` — without a window.
//!
//! See `docs/handoffs/agent-host.md` for the plan this implements, and §0 of it
//! for the rules: no login token is ever read, stored or logged; the `claude`
//! binary runs unmodified with the user's own sign-in; prompts travel on stdin,
//! never on a command line; and no session starts outside a linked worktree
//! ([`Worktree`]).
