//! Loading and validating `veistra-tool.toml`, the per-tool run manifest.
//!
//! See `docs/tool-protocol.md` section 1 for the spec this implements. The
//! short version: every tool checkout carries one of these files, and it says
//! how to run the tool — its id, its frontend bundle, its core binary, and the
//! surfaces it can put on screen. Unknown keys are a hard error rather than a
//! warning, because a typo'd key that's silently ignored is a bug that only
//! shows up at runtime, and three of the fields (`dist`, `bin`, a surface's
//! `path`) are load-bearing for path safety: a tool is third-party code, and
//! nothing here should let its manifest point outside its own checkout.
//!
//! A package used to be exactly one surface, and the file said so — `[frontend]`
//! and `[core]` were both required and there was one of each. It carries several
//! now, because a repository worth installing is usually several related views
//! over one domain rather than a single window. See [`ToolManifest`] for the
//! shape that came out of that and what each combination means.

// Published contract — see the note in crates/veistra-rpc/src/lib.rs.
