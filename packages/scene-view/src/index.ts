/**
 * `@kaava/scene-view`: an interactive glTF preview for the Godot and
 * Blender viewers. See `SceneView.tsx` for how the pieces fit, and
 * `markupHost.ts` for the contract the markup layer consumes.
 *
 * Shipped as TypeScript source rather than a built `dist/`, unlike
 * `@openkaava/bridge`: it is private to this repository and imports CSS, and a
 * second bundler pass would only get in the way of Vite's tree-shaking of
 * three.js.
